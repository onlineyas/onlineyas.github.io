# Lab 4: Voyant
## Introduction
[Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/) is a web-based tool for text analysis that is designed to combine ease of use with a sophisticated array of visualization methods.[^1] 
## Lab Questions

- **Question 1: How does this change the word cloud, and what are these changes telling you? Write down a short answer in your notes document.**
   - By default, Voyant assumes that some words can be removed from the body of the text. We can go through them and customize them. 
    However, from my understanding, Voyant is programmed by default, or given, so that it removes prepositions or linking words and etc such a,an the and etc. They're called structure words in some researche works and papers.
   - It’s term-frequency based and available in limited languages. 


- **Question 2: Why is relative frequency sometimes a more useful or accurate measure of a term’s importance than raw frequency?**  
  
  
  Relative frequency counts a word frequency divided by a million words. However, the raw frequency counts it independently among the whole corpus. They both say two different things. One is relative, the other abstract.
  
  Relative frequency can tell us about the density of a certain word somewhere in the corpus, in a document. The word will stand out for its repetition. This repetition can be interesting and make it worthwhile to go through this word and that specific document in the corpus. We might ask ourselves: Is this an anomaly? Is there anything about this word to do with the content? How is this result helping me with my research question?

  This is noteworthy to understand we are in the section of "trends" and not just overall information about all of the corpus. In this spreadsheet in this section, words are sorted BY a calculated number of relative frequencies. (Because we chose to sort it this way when following the lab instruction and clicking on relative frequency). The "relative" column tells us a certain word has been trendy in terms of *relative frequency* in exactly which document – and again, not the whole corpus.

  In the example we worked on, although *students* with the repetition of 3353 times in the whole corpus are the most-repeated word, the word *mcas* has the highest relative frequency number calculated in document number 442.

  In conclusion, relative frequency can be a factor to look at when it comes to trends and the density of repetition of words in individual documents.

- **Question 3: What is this document? And, more importantly, what have you learned about the term “mcas” in our corpus overall, and/or the utility or value of “significance” metrics like TF-IDF? Write down short answers to these questions in your notes document.**
  
  
  The metric is TTF-IDF, and It's a way representing a unique parameter. [This](https://towardsdatascience.com/tf-term-frequency-idf-inverse-document-frequency-from-scratch-in-python-6c2b61b78558) is how this number is calculated. As we see, *mcas* is shown to be one of those words that are unique to a particular document in the corpus based on the TF-IDF score. By digging into that part of the document, we will see that this word is the acronym of *Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences*. It appears so much because these are the names of professors and students that the document us demanding full-time employment for within the university. 

  This word happens only in one article, and this word is the name of the school and not (much of) a content word. This word is not adding meaning to the corpus if the content of the text is crucial for you. You might want to add it to stopword's list in this case.

  According to Voyant's results, this word is the most significant in the corpus. The reality is these significant words shown by Voyant need to be checked by humans. The content and the research question(s) matter! Suppose the question is "How do newspapers talk about humanities?". In that case, this is not an answer you're looking for unless your research question centers around this specific college and the story behind it.

   All in all, this word is *statistically significant*, but check twice and decide does this word have any content value for your research?

- **Question 4: Looking through this list of terms and their “Comparison” values, what observations can you make about terms that are more likely to occur in the humanities corpus vs. terms that are more likely to occur in the science corpus? How are these terms different? Write down short answers to these questions in your notes document.**

  Interestingly, the words *students*, *faculty* or *course* are among most repeated **compared to** the science document. To me, it seems to me that newspapers in humanities are mostly talking about the situation between students, professors and inside organizational decisions or situations. In contrast, we have *research*, *health* or *human* that are mostly repeated in science newsletter and university newspapers. I might interpret that in science majors, the focus is less organizational and more about research- and this is only a rough , general and not fully-examined interpretation at the first sight. How interesting that the word *new* has a minus value, meaning it is more repeated in science rather than humanities. 



- **Question 5: What tool(s) did you explore? What did this tool(s) help you to observe about this data and/or what did you learn about this data using this tool(s)? Alternatively, what did you hope to learn about this data using this tool and how (or why) did reality seem to fall short of that expectation? Write down short answers to these questions in your notes document.**

  - **Links**: I used the *Links* a lot. It's wonderful to see how the words are linked together and many analysis can be born within this tool. In this example, I can see how *research* is shown the biggest, not because it is the most frequent word, but because how it has been used with so many other key words such as *professos* and *technology* for instance. *Research* is linked to top keywords. The word *said*, which is the most repeated word, is instead connected to collocated words.
   This Colocated Graph, *represents a network graph where keywords in green are shown linked to collocates in maroon. You can hover over a term to see its frequency (for keywords it's the corpus frequency, for collocates it's the frequeny in the context of the linked keywords).*[^2] The proximity of words matter here, not only their frequency, which is a valuable tool in analyzing a text.

   - **Terms Burry**: This is also an interesting tool that *is intended to mix the power of visualizing high frequency terms with the utility ofexploring how those same terms co-occur (that is, to what extend they appear in proximity with one another). In some ways it's like Cirrus (the word cloud) but even more useful with the added collocates and corpus coverage information.* [^3]
  with this terms, not only keywords, but also collacted words can be seen without link lines, but with nodes. These are all used in DH for different purposes and different modes of visualisations, again, depending on research questions and the purpose of the scholars.

## Discussions and Reflections

- Discuss your experience doing some exploratory data analysis in this week’s lab in relation to at least one of our readings assigned for this week (week 5).
