# Lab Report 2
## Introduction: Spreadsheets
This week's lab was about spreadsheets. As a tool to create datasets and to make relevances among each datum, spreadsheets are essential to explore in social science and the humanities. There are a lot that can be done with spreadsheets that I hope I one day become confident enough to do so. Also, leaning how to read the data and understand it on a spreadsheet matters in research projects. In short, Spreadsheets are [only] a way to structure the avilable [given/found] knowledge ;meaning data.

## Links to Spreadsheets:
Here are the links to both datasets that we are going to discuss in this post.
- [Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KYYxc5ZJdavs9ooPrCzEo31H7Zz8wZPVLosmqQZu7qk/edit?usp=sharing)  
- [Post45 HathiTrust dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1atPbODEX_wqlSdkwk9_lxIKm4MRuDTXkcJD7fsZHG-I/edit?usp=sharing).

## Initial Observations
### Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade dataset
I had a hard time contextually understanding Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database. It might stem from my lack of knowledge in the history of Americas, the United States and Slavery. I assume a general descption about a dataset can be always hellful although creating one might be a rather critical task, as we saw in readings such as [Data Feminism](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/data-feminism). 

All in all, as I understood and at the very first glance, this dataset contains metadata about differetn voyages. In each, the slavers have been traded. The voyages took place between 1500-1900. Information such as the captain's name, the flag on each ship, the travel dates (including departure and arrival), the location of departure and arrival and similliar metadata has been given for each voyage.

### Post45 HathiTrust dataset
According to its one-line short description, this dataset is a table with metadata for fiction held by HathiTrust from 1945 to the present. I found this minimal description very useful. Suppose I am about to present a dataset one day. In that case, I will make sure to insert a relatively neutral, short, and general explanation for the table of data. It gives an instant idea of what data we are looking at.

I was not familiar with all the entries. There are some OCIDs of fiction given. Authors' names, publishers, dates such as publishing, etc., are provided. Unlike the other dataset that consisted of some data from an old-time about humans being traded in one of the most tragic and sensitive times and events of history, We are dealing with information about books here. 

I followed the description. This [table](https://view.data.post45.org/index#) has description about each column. I did not understand what a data type is. The glitch was every time you click on one of these question marks, the whole page pushes you back to the first columns and the left side of the table, which makes it hard to go forward and explore all.


It is noteworthy to acknowledge how these two datasets are different in nature. The process of recording events, numbers, and names that have been done by unknown people (unknown to me: I mean, who were the people counting the people on each ship? There is a lot that can be asked here, but it is impossible to find out probably.). Trusting this metadata is an assumption we decide to make. However, printed books might have come from a somewhat different procedure. Books are still solid items. They can be read; if they are published, the content and other information are recorded by machines from the very beginning. 


### General Challenges with Both Datasets

I found it a bit confusing to work with rows and columns. I went ahead and google ofcourse, but it took me a while to tell the difference between COUNT and COUNTA and VAR for instance.

## Question of the week: to Discuss and Reflect


 What do the spreadsheets we explored in this weekâ€™s lab make it possible to know or to study or to question, and what do they occlude or make impossible to know or to study or to question?
 
 With all the discussions we had during the previous weeks, I assume labeling and categorization is still a sensitive issue. For instance, I tried to chart the genre of "Jewish Fiction" and count them and try to answer to this question that how many Jewish fiction has been published in different years. The point is, I wonder who labeled the genres? Why others are N/A and why these specific ones are marked as Jewish fiction? I assume researching about where data comes from, is quite necessary. Likewise, Having an idea of the researchers who saw the materials first-handed, labelled them and digitized them and therefore created the dataset, is quite important.
 In this case, this question can be researched through their website, because these are quite known projects. But this question needs to be always asked before charting and analyzing the data.
