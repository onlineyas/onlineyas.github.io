# RegEx

## Introduction

A regular expression, or regex for short, is a pattern describing a certain amount of text [^1]. Many applications and programming languages have their own implementation of regular expressions, often with slight and sometimes with significant differences from other implementations. When two applications use a different implementation of regular expressions, we say that they use different “regular expression flavors”. This quick start explains the syntax supported by the most popular regular expression flavors[^2].

## Steps: Trials and Errors

So, *keeping the top “Substitution” box blank (where it says “insert your replacement value here”), what do you notice about the output data below? Where have the quotation marks gone? What if, instead of substituting nothing for all quotation marks, you instead substituted a tab character (\t)? Or a comma?*

The quotation marks are gone because, as advised, we replaced them with nothing. It’s funny that if we put a comma, for instance, we will replace them with commas, meaning instead of every previous quotation mark, now there is a separate column. 

I used (")

Then I went with separating commas. I wanted to remove other punctuation characters as well too. I did not know how to do it in one shot. So i continued old-fashioned.

## Reflections and Discussions

Discuss your experience working with regular expressions in this week’s lab in relation to at least one of our readings assigned for this week (week 4). This discussion should be specific but it needn’t be long (i.e., 2-4 paragraphs).
