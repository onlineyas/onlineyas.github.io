# RegEx

## Introduction

A regular expression, or regex for short, is a pattern describing a certain amount of text [^1]. Many applications and programming languages have their own implementation of regular expressions, often with slight and sometimes with significant differences from other implementations. When two applications use a different implementation of regular expressions, we say that they use different “regular expression flavors”. This quick start explains the syntax supported by the most popular regular expression flavors[^2].

## Steps: Trials and Errors

So, *keeping the top “Substitution” box blank (where it says “insert your replacement value here”), what do you notice about the output data below? Where have the quotation marks gone? What if, instead of substituting nothing for all quotation marks, you instead substituted a tab character (\t)? Or a comma?*

The quotation marks are gone because, as advised, we replaced them with nothing. It’s funny that if we put a comma, for instance, we will replace them with commas, meaning instead of every previous quotation mark, now there is a separate column.

Then I went with separating commas. I wanted to remove other punctuation characters as well too. I did not know how to do it in one shot. So i continued old-fashioned. I removed all commas.

## Reflections and Discussions: Collaborative nature of Digital Humanities projects

Drawing from Ryan Cordell and Data Feminism Chapter 5, the **collaborative nature** of digital humanities was accentuated. Adopting an inclusive approach to various perspectives is the core key in such collaborations. Creating knowledge, therefore, is not a linear way in today's world and research, but it is more and more encouraged and valued to go in a multilinear direction.

Working with RegEx to clean a piece of text for a humanities project was an on-point experience. I had a flash-back to engineering years and how we used to employ codes and commands to read between the lines and work on a text. Back at the time, none of us had a humanist approach.

I'm not good at talking too much about things that appear too obvious. Still, I can try to articulate my opinion with an example: When I was working on a project at the age of 12 with my friends to write a basic program on C that would convert "Fingilish" text messages to Persian, meaning Persian typed by English alphabets, to Persian with original alphabets. It was hard to type in Persian with those old press-button phones, but also it was cheaper to send a text message with Persian letters. The government passed this law so that communicating in the made-up "Finglish" letters won't go viral. I remember we never had a linguistic approach or knowledge. We were struggling to teach the machine to read those Finglish texts and convert them to Persian letters- and it was much more complicated than it sounds. For instance, vowels are not written in the Persian language, and they are when you use English alphabets. The challenge was how to convert a "salam" to سلام, meaning hello and not to سلم, a name for boys. This is one example of a linguistic challenge among many. The act of **detecting what knowledge from what disciplinary is needed** also matters. Humanists now can do a better job at understanding what expertise is needed in such projects.

This blank space always existed in tech projects with only computer scientists or engineers involved. Even when hiring or creating a job offer, it is essential to know who to invite to apply. That is why I assume when it comes to *cleaning data*, the presence of interdisciplinary humanists as project managers are necessary. It's high time to acknowledge, as Cordell also states, *it's that there is significantly more opportunity for interdisciplinary cooperation*.
