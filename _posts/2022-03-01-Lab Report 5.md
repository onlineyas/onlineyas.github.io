# Python and Jupyter Notebooks
## Introduction

## Questions
**Q1:** What do you notice about how this function has split the string “Okay, okay, ladies, now let’s get in formation, cause I slay”? What has it done that isn’t quite right, and why has it done this? 

Computer thinks that *s* is a word. 
Splitting words using that regular expression, the plit happens on any non-word charachter. 
Space, commas, apasrophes and all non-chars are considered to be non-alpahebtic.

Hower if we use **/s** , only spaces are detected and separation happens based on spaces.
```
import re

def split_into_words(any_chunk_of_text):
    #split the string into individual terms and make them all lowercase
    words = re.split("\s+", any_chunk_of_text.lower())
    return words 

any_chunk_of_text = "I'm doing fine! What about you? let's chat"

all_the_words = split_into_words(any_chunk_of_text)
print(all_the_words)
```

Output:
```
["i'm", 'doing', 'fine!', 'what', 'about', 'you?', "let's", 'chat']
```
**Q2:** What happened? Did it work as you expected? If not, what happened that you didn’t expect? 

```
import re

def split_into_words(any_chunk_of_text):
    #split the string into individual terms and make them all lowercase
    words = re.split("\W+", any_chunk_of_text.lower())
    return words 

any_chunk_of_text = "I'm doing fine! What about you? let's chat"

all_the_words = split_into_words(any_chunk_of_text)
print(all_the_words)
```

This is the **list** printed:
```
['i', 'm', 'doing', 'fine', 'what', 'about', 'you', 'let', 's', 'chat']
```
Nothing unexpected happened. Computer did as expected like Q1.


**Q3:** Describe the output of this script (the dataframe that displays after the above cell finishes running). Remember that this is the same output as the “vir-ver-counts-specific” spreadsheet in our Lab5 Google drive folder, only for just 10 texts.
